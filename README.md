# VGG19-Transfer-Learn
TensorFlow implementation of VGG19 with Transfer Learning. The model is based on this implementation. 

This repository is used as a teaching aid, for demonstraing the effectiveness of data augmentation, in this [medium blog]().

## Requirements:
- Python 3.5
- TensorFlow 1.4
- Keras (Only for converting labels to one-hot, you can replace that with numpy)
- Jupyter

## Steps:
- Fork/Clone this repository.
- Download VGG19.npy from [here](https://mega.nz/#!xZ8glS6J!MAnE91ND_WyfZ_8mvkuSa2YcA7q-1ehfSm-Q1fxOvvs), place it in this repository.
- Download the example data from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GpIpbqBQ_ak1Z_4yAj7t6YRqDDyyBbAq?usp=sharing).
